UTF_Display_BMP_Files
=====================

This code was cobbled together from UTF library examples and Adafruit display bmp files routines. 
Modification was made to the CET TFT board forDUE by soldering jumper 8 so that pin 53 is now SD CS pin.
The bmpDraw function was originally created by Written by Limor Fried/Ladyada for Adafruit Industries.
